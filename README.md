# Energy Consumption Analysis: Electricity and Chilled Water (BDG2 Dataset)


This project focuses on analyzing and processing a subset of the [BDG2 open dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/chuanfutan/energy-consumption-forecasting-project/input) that includes energy consumption measurements from various buildings. Specifically, this analysis is limited to **electricity** and **chilled water** meter readings, offering insights into their usage patterns across a two-year period (2016‚Äì2017).

## üìä Dataset Description

The full BDG2 dataset comprises:
- **3,053 energy meters** from **1,636 buildings**
- **Hourly readings** for the years **2016 and 2017**
- Data includes various types of meters:
  - Electricity
  - Heating water
  - Cooling water (Chilled water)
  - Steam
  - Irrigation

A subset of this dataset was used in the [Great Energy Predictor III (GEPIII)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction) competition hosted by ASHRAE in 2019, aimed at machine learning-based long-term energy prediction.

## üîç Project Focus

This repository concentrates exclusively on:
- **Electricity meters**
- **Chilled water (cooling) meters**

The objective is to:
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Explore temporal patterns and correlations
- Prepare data for further statistical or machine learning analysis
